react is a library and creates single page application


react doesn't have state managagement and hence we take help of other libriaries like redux, redux toolkit,context API

to navigate between pages we use the package react-router (react doesn't have router) 

BAAS apps - backend as a service

vite and parcel are bundler
bundler take all the project file and combines them into one file to run in browser.

react -> react-dom (usualyy for websites)
      -> react-native(usually for mobile apps)


2 ways to cretae a react project:
one is thru npx create-react-app react-app
npm start
much slower than with implementation of vite 


and the other way is using vite
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev

we mainly work with the src folder 
the package.json allows us to kno various dependecies required
